## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* [pip and virtualenv](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4324558)

## Quick Start

```
virtualenv venv

# On Windows, replace the following line with 'venv\Scripts\activate'.
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.minimal.txt
python manage.py syncdb
```

You will be asked if you want to create an admin user. Do this, then run:

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, you can visit http://localhost:8000/admin and log in as your
new admin user.

## Environment Variables

Unlike traditional Django settings, we use environment variables
for configuration to be compliant with [twelve-factor][] apps.

**Note:** When an environment variable is described as representing a
boolean value, if the variable exists with *any* value (even the empty
string), the boolean is true; otherwise, it's false.

**Note:** When running `manage.py`, the following environment
variables are given default values: `SECRET_KEY`, `PORT`, `ORIGIN`,
`EMAIL_BACKEND_URL`. Also, `DEBUG` is enabled.

* `SECRET_KEY` is a large random value.
* `DEBUG` is a boolean value that indicates whether debugging is enabled
  (this should always be false in production).
* `PORT` is the port that the server binds to.
* `ORIGIN` is the origin of the server, as it appears
  to users. If `DEBUG` is enabled, this defaults to
  `http://localhost:PORT`. Otherwise, it must be defined.
* `DATABASE_URL` is the URL for the database. Defaults to a `sqlite://`
  URL pointing to `db.sqlite3` at the root of the repository. If this
  value is the name of another (all-caps) environment variable, e.g.
  `HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL`, that variable's value will be used
  as the database URL.
* `EMAIL_BACKEND_URL` is a URL representing the email backend to use.
  Examples include `console:`, `smtp://hostname:port`, and
  `smtp+tls://user:pass@hostname:port`.
* `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` is an optional HTTP request header field name
  and value indicating that the request is actually secure. For example,
  Heroku deployments should set this to `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`.
